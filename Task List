In no particular order...

1)  Determine what kind of new variables we want to create.
  -FPL, AnnualIncome -Are they colinear?  Make bins.
  -Primary language not english flag
  -Possibly reduce Education to 2 or 3 values? (BS)
  -Consecutive months active
  -Household with or without children flag (based on FamilyTypeID.  Figure out what to do about Other and Undeclared)
  -Check distributions of DwellingType to see if we want flags around Homeless and Emergency Shelter
  -Review Characteristics and see if any should be combined into flags
  -In town with NOI campus flag.  Maybe separate flags for each of those towns?  Maybe categorical with Waterbury, 
    Torrington, Meriden and Other?

2)  Determine if we want to do any binning or grouping of values in our variables.

3)  Search for and determine what to do with missing/NULL values.

4)  Search for outliers, and determine a method for dealing with them

5)  Get template set up for a report. (Annie)
    COMPLETE:  Template available on Google Drive. 

6)  Gather code used to this point and put on Git hub. 
    COMPLETE:  Code available.

7)  Fix data tables so we are getting DateMonthlyKey >= 92 (Ben)
    COMPLETE:  Only data being used is from March 2017 - June 2017.  
      I believe this is because that is the only reliable financial data, 
      but we may need to research and ensure this is the appropriate date range (BB).

8)  Brainstorm potential targets.
  -Difference between previous assessment and current.  Did Person get better or worse?
  -Assessment score
